# Cryptography

You will implement two cryptosystems:
    [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
    [VigenÃ¨re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)
    

Draw a flowchart for this [problem](#problem).

## Problem 

Implement the cryptosystem in section Cryptography. 

### Requirements:
- Flowchart
- Has a command-line interface
- Use modularization as much as possible, i.e., header files, functions for repetitive code.
- What was your modularization approach to each part you have implemented, i.e., CLI, Caesar, Vigenere? 1-3 sentences per part are enough. Include this test in your README.
- For your header files you use include folder.
- Your header file is documented using Doxygen syntax.
